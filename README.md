## Hello world ! üåç
<p align="left"> 
  
Welcome to my GitHub profile, a repository for my projects and contributions in Geospatial Data Science with a specialized focus on Remote Sensing for environmental applications. My academic background includes a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Environmental Management and a MBA in Data Science and Analytics. This profile highlights my work in geospatial data science, integrating remote sensing, spatial database management, machine learning, and data visualization to address critical environmental challenges. Here you'll find projects related to: <br><br>

* Deforestation and Degradation Detection: Using multi-sensor approaches for deforestation monitoring, including time series analysis, change detection algorithms, deforestation risk assessment, and forest cover classification.

* Agricultural Monitoring: Leveraging multispectral and radar data to monitor crop health, estimate yields, and detect agricultural risks such as pest and disease outbreaks, using vegetation indices, phenological metrics, and crop classification.

* Climate and Weather Analysis: Developing tools to analyze climate data (precipitation, temperature, drought indices) using Google Earth Engine for comprehensive climate and weather assessments.

* Fire Detection and Monitoring: Detecting active fires and mapping burned areas with MODIS and Sentinel-2 data. Includes fire hotspot detection, burn severity assessment, and post-fire recovery analysis.

* Water Resources Management: Analyzing hydrological data for watershed delineation, water quality monitoring, and flood risk assessment, utilizing various remote sensing and GIS techniques.

* Spatial Data Management: Engineering robust spatial data infrastructures to support complex analyses, utilizing PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Spark and BigQuery to manage, query, and process large-scale geospatial data for efficient workflows and high-performance analyses.
