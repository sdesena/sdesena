## Hi there, welcome ! üåç
<p align="left"> This GitHub profile serves as a repository for my projects and contributions in the field of geospatial data science for environmental applications. I encourage you to explore my work and connect with me if you share my passion for leveraging data for a more sustainable future. My background includes a degree in environmental management, coupled with an MBA focused on Data Science and Analytics. I'm developing projects related to: <br><br>
  
- Deforestation and Forest Degradation Detection: monitoring deforestation and forest degradation with multiple sensors. Time series analysis, change detection algorithms, deforestation risk assessment, forest cover classification. <br><br>
- Agricultural Monitoring: multispectral and radar data to monitor crop health, estimate yield, and detect pests and diseases with vegetation indices, phenological metrics, and classification of crop types.<br><br>
- Climate and Weather Analysis: tools to access and analyze climate data, such as precipitation, temperature, and drought indices, using GEE.<br><br>
- Fire Detection and monitoring: detecting active fires and mapping burned areas using MODIS and Sentinel-2 data. Fire hotspot detection, burn severity assessment, and post-fire vegetation recovery analysis.<br><br>
- Water Resource Management: tools and scripts for analyzing hydrological data, watershed delineation, water quality and flood risk assessment.<br><br>
- Spatial Database Magamement: data engeneering with postgreSQL, postGIS, Google Big Query, Hadoop and Spark.<br><br>
- WebGIS applications: integrate GEE with web technologies to create dynamic WebGIS applications that leverage real-time satellite imagery data visualization and user-friendly interactive mapping. <br><br>

### Contributions and Collaboration
